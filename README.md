### UCI HAR Dataset Cleaning

## Objectives

From the UCI HAR Dataset, the following tasks were accomplished :

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity -   and each subject.

## Code

The transformation of the original data was done using the following R file : run_analysis.R

The output is a file called "tidy_data.txt".

## Variables of the Tidy Data

They can be found using the CodeBook in the repo.
